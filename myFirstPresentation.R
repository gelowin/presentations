#' Last year [eoda.de](https://blog.eoda.de/2016/12/21/rstatsgoes10k-eoda-is-hosting-a-contest-in-celebration-of-r/)
#' launched a contest to predict when the R packages will be 10k. So this
#' is a really good opportunity to use (finally) the `forecastHybrid` package developed by 
#' [Peter Ellis](http://ellisp.github.io/) and David Shaub.
#' 
#' > This will be a really KISS-naive-simply-raw try to get a
#' > reasonable prediction. No transformations, no CV. etc. But you can do better!

#' The data will be extracted from the list of packages by date from CRAN.
#' Then we'll make some wrangling to get the cumulative sum of the packages
#' by day.

packages <- "https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_date.html" %>% 
  read_html() %>% 
  html_table() %>%
  .[[1]] %>% 
  tbl_df()

names(packages) <- tolower(names(packages))

packages <- mutate(packages, date = ymd(date))

glimpse(packages)

c(min(packages$date), max(packages$date))

data <- packages %>% 
  group_by(date) %>% 
  summarise(n = n()) %>% 
  left_join(data_frame(date = seq(min(packages$date), max(packages$date), by = 1)),
            ., by = "date")

data <- data %>% 
  mutate(
    n = ifelse(is.na(n), 0, n),
    cumsum = cumsum(n)

#' 
#' A little weird the effect in the 2014. Let's drop some past
#' information and create some auxiliar variables.
#' 
data <- filter(data, year(date) >= 2013)

date_first <- first(data$date)
date_last <- last(data$date)

#' To use the package we need first a time series object:

z <- zooreg(data$cumsum, start = date_first, frequency = 1)
tail(z)


#'  Now we can use the `forecastHybrid::hybridModel` function. In this case
#'  I removed the `tbats` model due the long time to fit, the long time to 
#'  make CV and the long long time to make the predictions (in my previous tests).
#'  So, in the spirit to be parsimonious and KISS we will remove this model
#'  from the fit.

# hm <- hybridModel(z, models = "aefns", weights = "cv.errors", errorMethod = "MASE")
# saveRDS(hm, "data/rstatsgoes10k/hm.rds")
hm <- readRDS("data/rstatsgoes10k/hm.rds")
hm

#' It is really simple to get the forecasts. After the calculate them we will
#' create a `data_frame` to filter and see what day R will have 10k 
#' packages according this methodology.

H <- 20
fc <- forecast(hm, h = H)

data_fc <- fc %>% 
  as_data_frame() %>% 
  mutate(date = date_last + days(1:H)) %>%

#' which is the upper limit from the 95% interval.

#' Simple, right? Maybe the that will not be the day where R hit 10k packages but its
#' doesn't matter. The __really important fact here__ is all this is product of many many 
#' developers joined by the community, and some Rheroes like HW, JO, JB, GC, JC, BR, MA,
#' DR, JS, KR and many others who have astonished us package by package or show our work
#' in the social media . Thanks to everybody I can using this versatile and powerful language
#' happily day by day.
